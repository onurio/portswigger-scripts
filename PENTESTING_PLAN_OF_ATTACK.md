- CL.TE: Front-end uses CL, back-end uses TE
- TE.CL: Front-end uses TE, back-end uses CL
- TE.TE: Obfuscating Transfer-Encoding header
- HTTP/2 request smuggling
- Browser-powered request smuggling

**Bypass Techniques:**
- Obfuscating Transfer-Encoding headers
- Exploiting HTTP/1.1 protocol ambiguities
- Manipulating request body parsing
- Chunked encoding manipulation
- Request tunneling techniques
- H2.CL and H2.TE variants

**Key Points:**
- Client-side desync attacks
- Response queue poisoning
- Request tunneling for hidden attacks
- Prevention: use HTTP/2 end-to-end
- Normalize ambiguous requests
- Reject requests violating specification
- Disable connection reuse to back-end
- Patch intermediary systems
- Impact: bypass security controls, poison caches, hijack sessions
- Severity: Critical

### OAuth Authentication
**URL:** https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth

**Description:**
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework used for third-party authentication, allowing websites to access limited user data without exposing login credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Improper implicit grant type implementation
- Exploiting weak token storage and validation
- Manipulating user data submission requests
- CSRF protection flaws
- Token and code leakage
- Scope validation bypasses

**Bypass Techniques:**
- Manipulating `redirect_uri` parameters
- Using localhost/subdomain tricks
- Exploiting URI parsing inconsistencies
- Server-side parameter pollution
- Stealing authorization codes
- Scope upgrade attacks

**Key Points:**
- Authorization Code vs Implicit Grant Types
- OpenID Connect extensions
- Client-side vs server-side implementation
- State parameter prevents CSRF
- Prevention: implement robust state validation
- Strictly validate `redirect_uri`
- Implement secure token storage
- Validate scope permissions thoroughly
- Use PKCE for mobile/SPA applications
- Never leak tokens in Referer header

### JWT Attacks
**URL:** https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt

**Description:**
JWT (JSON Web Token) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in token-based authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to bypass security controls and potentially compromise entire web applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Signature verification bypass
- Accepting arbitrary signatures
- Accepting tokens with no signature
- Manipulating token payload claims
- Secret key brute-forcing
- Header parameter injections (`jwk`, `jku`, `kid`)

**Bypass Techniques:**
- Setting `alg` header to `none`
- Embedding self-signed public keys
- Manipulating key identification mechanisms
- Exploiting inconsistent signature verification
- Algorithm confusion attacks (RS256 to HS256)
- Path traversal via `kid` parameter

**Key Points:**
- JWT format: header.payload.signature
- Difference between JWT, JWS, and JWE
- Cryptographic signature generation
- Header parameter exploitation techniques
- Prevention: use updated JWT libraries
- Implement strict signature verification
- Enforce algorithm whitelisting
- Validate and sanitize all token parameters
- Never trust user-supplied JWK
- Use strong secret keys (256+ bits)

### Prototype Pollution
**URL:** https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution

**Description:**
Prototype pollution is a JavaScript vulnerability that enables an attacker to add arbitrary properties to global object prototypes, potentially leading to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- URL query string manipulation
- JSON input injection
- Recursive object merging without sanitization
- Targeting `__proto__` to modify inheritance
- Exploiting configuration objects
- Targeting default settings

**Bypass Techniques:**
- Injecting properties via `__proto__`
- Using JSON parsing for malicious properties
- Targeting inherited properties in config objects
- Exploiting libraries with weak validation
- Constructor.prototype pollution
- Polluting Object.prototype

**Key Points:**
- Client-side: can lead to DOM XSS
- Server-side: potential remote code execution
- Sources: URL parameters, JSON inputs, web messages
- Requires: pollution source, sink, exploitable gadget
- Prevention: sanitize property keys
- Use Object.create(null) for dictionaries
- Freeze Object.prototype
- Validate JSON schema
- Use Map instead of objects
- Avoid recursive merge functions without validation
